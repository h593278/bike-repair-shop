# project structure

The project have following containers:
* Frontend with react and TS
* API with C#
* API with Node.js
* Maybe a dedicated backend solution for logic
* Database with....

Everything have a separate docker container. There should also be possible to get notification from the backend to the frontend, the final solution is not finalized but it is preferred to use Service Worker.
